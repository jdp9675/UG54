    "**🎯 Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decode the α / β decomposition.**  \n",
    "   Learn how any asset’s excess return can be split into a factor‐driven piece (β × factor) and an asset-specific alpha, and see how this dual role lets factor models describe both risk and expected return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Estimate factor exposure and alpha with regression.**  \n",
    "   Use time-series regressions of excess returns on factor returns to obtain β, α, residuals, and the associated statistics that guide portfolio design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create tracking and hedged portfolios.**  \n",
    "   Build a *tracking* portfolio equal to β times the factor, and a *hedged* (portable-alpha) portfolio that subtracts the tracking position—delivering pure alpha with zero in-sample factor risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Size positions under explicit risk budgets.**  \n",
    "   Apply volatility budgets at daily, monthly, or annual horizons; compute how much capital you can allocate to an unhedged position versus a hedged one, given its variance components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Perform variance decomposition and risk-share analysis.**  \n",
    "   Break total variance into a factor part (β² Var f) and an idiosyncratic part (Var ε); measure the fraction of factor risk and adjust hedges to meet risk-share limits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Build factor-implied covariance matrices.**  \n",
    "   See how a single-factor structure collapses the number of parameters from O(N²) to O(N); practice constructing the matrix as \\(B B' Var f + \\text{diag}(\\sigma_ε^2)\\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Appreciate the practical uses of factor models.**  \n",
    "   Understand why asset managers, pod shops, and risk desks rely on factor models to separate skill from beta, impose discipline on risk taking, and communicate performance.\n",

    "Let $f$ be a traded factor, for now  the excess returns on SPY ETF (that holds a basket that replicates the S&P 500 index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^e=\\alpha + b*f+\\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b$ is asset $i$ exposure to the factor $f$\n",
    "\n",
    "> We can always write things that way--it is just a statistical decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be useful for measuring risk if\n",
    "    - The risk $\\epsilon$ is specific to asset $i$ and only weakly correlated with other assets (ideally completely)\n",
    "    - i.e if the factor explains lots of the common variation in stock returns \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It can be useful for measuring expected returns if\n",
    "    - The premium on the factor f, $E[f]$ summarize well the known \"priced\" systematic risk factors\n",
    "    - By \"priced\" we mean risk-factors that earn a risk premium  $E[f]>0$\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will call the first a factor model of risk, and the second a factor model of expected returns. However, this distinction is often blurry. \n",
    "\n",
    "People start with a factor model with priced factors and then add additional factors to explain risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What use is a factor model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- the alpha/Beta decomposition is how the money management industry is organized. \n",
    "    - Big pay days only if people think you have alpha\n",
    "    - Getting exposure to the factor is a commodity. Anyone can buy SPY or many other funds that track the market very well\n",
    "    - In most funds, specially for portfolio managers working a pod shops like Citadel (https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/citadel-ken-griffin-hedge-funds-c9ddf51d) and Millenium (https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-giant-hedge-fund-that-hates-risk-and-still-wins-1110e90a), a portfolio manager mandate is to take no factor risk--or at least aim to be close to factor neutral.\n",
    "    - It is all about the alpha \n",
    "- factor models allow you to understand and hedge risk\n",
    "    - This is essential if you want to concentrate your portfolio only on risks that you get compensated for holding\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Hedging out β turns views into “portable” alpha.**  \n",
    "  Going long the asset and short β units of the factor neutralizes systematic risk, leaving a position whose mean excess return equals its alpha and whose volatility equals the residual variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk budgets shrink once you hedge intelligently.**  \n",
    "  A hedged position’s lower volatility allows you to deploy more capital for the same risk cap—and to earn more alpha-attributed P&L.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance decomposition is your monitoring dashboard.**  \n",
    "  It tells you how much of today’s risk is coming from factors versus idiosyncratic shocks and highlights when market turmoil swells the factor share.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tracking portfolios clarify performance attribution.**  \n",
    "  By explicitly matching the factor component, you can assess whether a manager’s outperformance is genuine skill or just hidden beta.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor-implied covariance matrices are parsimonious and , maybe, more intuitive.**  \n",
    "  Estimating only N betas, N idiosyncratic variances, and one factor variance yields a workable covariance estimate even when the full N × N matrix is unmanageable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **All numbers are frequency-specific.**  \n",
    "  Alpha, variances, co-variances and Sharpe ratios must be annualized (or otherwise scaled) consistently before comparison or budgeting.  Beta is the only one that is theoretically invariant \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Good questions drive good models.**  \n",
