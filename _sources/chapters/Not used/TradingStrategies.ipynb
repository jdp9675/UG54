    "* A trading strategy is a procedure that maps any information known up to time t, into a set of trading instructions for time  $T>t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - the mean-variance analysis we did so far was **not** a valid trading strategy: \n",
    "   - we used data of the whole sample to estimate the weights of our strategy and evaluated the strategy in the same sample\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is very important that the trading strategy only uses information that is known at the time of the trade\n",
    "* -- you obviously cannot trade on info that you don't know\n",
    "\n",
    "* The weights of a trading strategy must either:\n",
    "   * Add up to 1. So it describes what you do with your entire capital.\n",
    "   * Or add up to 0. So the strategy is self-financing. For example, borrow 1 dollar at the risk-free rate and buy 1 dollar worth of the market portfolio\n",
    "   * Every time you trade on the excess returns, you can think of the weights \"adding up to zero\", because it is a long-short portfolio.\n",
    "   * In practice all strategies demand some capital as no bank allow us to borrow without putting some capital in, but these self financed strategies are quite convenient to work with as they are all in the \"Excess Return Space\" since they have zero cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example of a VALID trading strategy: Every monday buy stocks that had positive news coverage during the weekend and sell stocks that had negative news coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This is valid because you are trading after the information is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example of INVALID trading strategy: On Friday buy all the stocks that WILL have positive news coverage during the weekend, and sell all the stocks that WILL have negative coverage during the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This is Invalid because you are trading before the information is known.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* This might sound ridiculous. Obviously you cannot trade on the information that is not known at the time of the trade!\n"

    "\n",
    "    -  The strategy takes positions on broader asset classes. For example pension funds tend to follow a 70-30 split between equity and bonds\n",
    "    -  An example is of this is the mean-variance anaylsis we did last few chapters.\n",
    "    -  We will revisit this here but now making the analysis more tight\n",
    "    -  Another example is RISK-PARITY which we will discuss later \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timing**: Easier to think in terms of one risky asset and cash. The strategy basically goes in and out of an asset according to some model that forecasts time-variaiton either in returns of the risky asset realitve to cash or in it's riskness\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You obvioulsy can time multiple things at the same time, but it is useful separation to help understand what the strategy is doing\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Cross-sectional** (within asset class): This is about how you invest within an asset class. The \"defaul\" option is to do a market-cap weighted portfolio which we will discuss below. The cross-sectional strategies use some information to deviate from the market portfolio in the asset class\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The are cross-sectional strategies everywhere: equities, gov bonds, corp bonds, futures, equity indexes, currencies, commodities, options, crypto currrencies\n",
    "    - All these asset classes have lots of data and are naturally a good place to do quantitative investing\n",
    "    - For this class we focus on equities\n",
